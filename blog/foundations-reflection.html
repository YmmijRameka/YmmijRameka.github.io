            <h3 class="title-top-white">What are some new things you have learned about yourself as a result of the core learning?</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>When i set challenges for myself i am more motivated to do my work and when its completed i feel a sense of accomplishment.</li>
                <li>My ego used to tell me ill look stupid if i ask too many questions, but now im able to ask a bit more without feeling as insecure. Without others' help i wouldn't have been able to move forward on a lot of code. Googling is less embarrassing but sometimes it's just easier and faster to ask others plus you will get a more direct answer.</li>
                <li>I need to trust the process and get out of my own way if i want to move forward in programming.</li>
                <li>I really need to work on taking breaks for my own wellbeing (this includes having better time management).</li> 
            </ol>
            
            
            <h3 class="title-top-white">What are the roles of values, self awareness, and empathy, in learning and programming?</h3>
            <p>
                Values are like my compass to help me decide how I will act and where I should go in order to find what is right for me 
                and what impact I want to make in the world with the work i do. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The more i know myself, my interests, strengths, weakness & limitations, The more i can place my attention on the areas 
                i need to improve and the better i can decide where i will be most valuable and happy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I will always be working with others so it's important that I take the time to put myself in their shoes and understand 
                their perspective and emotions. Even simply caring about whether the next person who's going to work on my code will be
                able to read it or not, can count as empathy and this is especially important on big collaborative projects. We aren't
                robots and for us to work well as a team we need to be able to get along. 
            </p> 
            
            <h3 class="title-top-white">What has surprised you the most about core learning?</h3>
            <p>
                The thing that surprised me most about the core learning was the listening and looping. I had never heard of this before 
                but doing it helped me learn just how bad my attention can be at times and knowing that I can work on it using this exercise 
                is awesome. 
            </p>
            
            <h3 class="title-top-white">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
            <p>
                I was not good at reading comprehension in school and a few of the questions I just didn't understand or know where to start 
                writing. I think I over-thought about it and ended up stressing myself out. Putting my thoughts into words was pretty 
                difficult for me and sometimes ended up all over the place but it got easier over time. 
                Another aspect was overcoming myself, i had to get over the fear of going blank and stuttering before i started the listening 
                and looping. I had to get over my fear of feeling inadequate before I asked questions on slack. And i had to shut out the 
                thoughts that told me i wasn’t going to finish in time, i wasn’t going to find an answer, or this is too hard for me. 
            </p> 
            
            <h3 class="title-top-white">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h3>
            <p>
                Well anyone can learn the tech side but not many take the time to learn the human side. Just like in any job, attitude is 
                more preferred than experience (in my opinion) Just like how my mother got a gardening job with zero experience while going 
                up against two qualified horticulturalists. Her attitude and heart was in the right place and she would get along with her 
                team very well because of it. The others interviewees had all the knowledge but were not pleasant people to be around and not 
                very hard workers. 
            </p>
          
            <p>
                We could've been given all the answers and still learnt programming but it would be up to chance whether we’d be good 
                collaborators, emotionally intelligent, and good resilient problem solvers. I like that with this program, you know you are 
                training to become the full package and knowing that industries will recognize that is pretty neat. 
            </p>
         
            <h3 class="title-top-white">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise 
                programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
            <p>
                No definitely not. I do think some of the questions feel forced and should be modified just to make it easier for us to answer 
                and more natural, But overall I think it was my favourite part. At first it did feel weird and like a waste of time but I 
                started to grow into it and enjoy it. I think the blogs we created will also be nice to show possible employers too once 
                we’ve tidied them up. It was interesting to learn new things about my brain, and felt good to take time to just be with me 
                and think about where i'm at.
