         <h3 class="title-top-white">What is emotional intelligence?</h3>

         <p>Emotional intelligence is a skill that can be learnt and improved upon. It is made up of two parts - You, and Others.</p>
         <p>The skill involves 1) being able to understand and manage your own emotions, and  2) read the emotions of others and respond to them accordingly.</p>

         <p class="box-text-EQ">In short, it means being a 'people person' to others and to yourself.<!--put in box--></p>
         </div>

         <h3 class="title-top-white">Someone with high EQ is:</h3>
             <ul>
                 <li>Someone who is present, focused, and self-aware, 
                 <li>Good at working in a team, 
                 <li>They care for their mental wellbeing, 
                 <li>They watch where they place their attention, 
                 <li>They sift through the thoughts they dont want and the thoughts they do want.
             </ul>



         <h3 class="title-top-white">How is it different from IQ?</h3> 
         <p>A person with a high IQ may be good at tech, or a master of their craft, but if they arent able to work well with others or manage their own emotions, they are very limited and will not grow as much as someone who might be sub-par in tech but great with emotional Intelligence.</p> 
         <div id="roundbox-smaller" class="roundbox-EQ">
         <p class = "box-text-EQ">IQ is knowing stuff - EQ is knowing people</p> <!--put in a box or something with rounded edges and nice pastel colour-->
         </div>

         <h3 class="title-top-white">Why is it so important?</h3>
         <h4 class="pink-h4">WORK:</h4> 
         <p>The people: Almost all work requires some type of communication and collaboration with others, so it is very necessary that we learn to develop this skill because people will be a big part of our work. </p>
         <P>we will be better at leadership, encouragement and resolving conflicts between the people we work with.</P>
         <p>Own Wellbeing: To be good at our work, we need our minds, and if our minds in a bad state, the quality of our work will deteriorate as time goes on.  

         <h4 class="pink-h4">PERSONAL LIFE:</h4>
         <p> we can calm ourselves when unpleasant feelings arise</p>
         <p> we will be able to Have better relationships because we are able to connect more</p>
         <p> we can be emotionally stronger and less reactive when something doesnt go our way or someone says something we dont agree with.</p>
