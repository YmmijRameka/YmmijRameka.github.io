            <h3 class="bbyblue-h3">What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
                <p>I am still getting a feel for web development and so far I am enjoying it. So if I continue to find it fulfilling or am still passionate about it, I want to create a career out of it. I don't have many (or any) ideas of where this might take me but i want to one day be able to work remotely/from home, and have my own business. I also want to be able to have time for other hobbies/ side-hustles and create something big (what? I don't know yet).</p>

            <h3 class="bbyblue-h3">A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
                <h4 class="pink-h4">Learning Strengths: </h4>
                <p>I would say I am a pretty fast learner but it really depends on how I learn. my brain takes snapshots of certain random info sometimes and it comes in handy but other times I cannot understand a concept unless I look at multiple explanations. So in short, i’d need the freedom and a little time to look around the web to understand some concepts and other times I just need to ask someone to clarify.</p>
                <p>I learn from videos/tutorials the best but i prefer to have an end task to work towards so i know what i need to pay attention to in that video rather than watching it just to watch it.</p>
                <p>My sense of urgency is what motivates me plus my joy for development and learning keeps me going doing the tasks each day and setting challenges for myself. I usually don't want to stop until work is done but i end up forgetting to take breaks. I am working on taking care of my wellbeing by using a timer to tell me when to take a break even when i don't feel like it.</p>



            <h4 class="pink-h4">Learning Limitations:</h4>
                <p>I am terrible at planning and organisation- i don’t like to plan things because i feel time will be wasted, but i end up wasting more time not planning (sometimes). i just like to get into work, but as i go, i will try to do better to organize myself.</p>
                <P>I don’t know how capable I am so I kinda freak myself out if I have tasks to do that are new to me, worrying if I'll be able to do it in time.</P>
                <p>I do sometimes forget about the learning competencies and end up getting caught up in unnecessary details sometimes. I would rather checklists instead of learning competencies (or i should ask for help in understanding the learning competencies).</p>
                <p>I dont always ask for help when I need it and I am learning to do this more often.</p>
                <p>Absorbing info then doing a task doesn’t work well for me because i will forget info straight away - i need to learn on the go (learn while doing), unless i have enough time to learn and absorb new info.</p>
                <p>Although I am excited to start working with others, I am a little anxious about collaborating. I feel I may be behind in terms of knowledge/skills. I also feel I will not be able to speak my mind on how I feel about certain projects.</p>



        <h3 class="bbyblue-h3">What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3>
          <ol>
              <li>I'd like to be able to speak confidently publicly</li>
              <li>I wanna be able to speak my mind and share my ideas as openly and respectfully as i can</li>
              <li>Firstly - gain an understanding of coding concepts and then be able to explain them to others easily</li>
              <li>Be able to manage my own mental health by taking breaks</li>
         </ol>

 

            <h3>Commitment - self-management & working with others:</h3> 
            <p>I will be respectful and considerate of others so as not to distract others while they work. I will do the work I say I am going to do and if I cant keep that promise (with good reason) I will let somebody know asap. When i have to work in teams i will pull my weight because if i dont do my work, everyone will suffer the consequences too.</p>
            <P><span style="color:pink">Productivity: </span>In order to work productively I am going to continue to set challenges for myself each day and work towards finishing those by the end of the day. I will use a timer to remind myself to take breaks for my own mental wellbeing and get back to work as soon as the timer runs out for my break. I usually start working as soon as i've taken care of myself in the morning but i understand i'll need to start getting up early when bootcamp comes around. So ill try to make it a goal to start earlier.</P>
            <p><span style="color:pink">Pressure: </span>When pressure starts to build and i’m almost at a breaking point i will take a break immediately and do some breathing exercises, meditation, or have some quiet time outside to process everything and settle my mind back down. Walks and getting out sound like a good option too just to give myself a change of environment and fresh air. I assume the things that will make me feel this way in the first place are not understanding what i'm supposed to do, so if this is the case i’ll need to remind myself to ask for help.</p>



            <h3>Commitment - seeking help</h3>  
            <p>If i need help i am going to ask for it from either the facilitators or other students at dev, or ask on one of the slack channels. I’ll ask as soon as I can ( max 30 minutes after I can't find a solution on my own).</p>
 
            <h3>What would I like from the facilitation team?</h3>
            <p>I would like facilitators to just help me as best they can or direct me to someone/someplace that can help me when I ask questions, I would like them to respond as soon as they can.</p>
            <p>Just a bit of direction because i have no idea what i am doing sometimes</p>

            <h3>Other commitments?</h3>
            <p>While i am doing foundations, i do alot of driving around for others - such as going to the store for my parents, and dropping off my neighbour in the mornings, picking up my mum from work. But these are only commitments i have during foundations. As soon as bootcamp starts i will have no commitments including driving anybody anywhere.</p>
