            <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
            
            <p>At a family Christmas party, two of my cousins had drunk a lot of alcohol that they could barely even walk and decided they wanted to drive back home early in the morning. Obviously they would be a danger to not only themselves but also the other people on the road. I thought about it, and if anything would have happened to my cousins or someone involved in the accident, i would regret not having tried to stop them from drunk driving. So we told some older adults about the situation and my mum came to give us a hand and that settled them both down for a while. But later on they wanted to go out again so we decided to hide the keys knowing they weren't in their right mind to think rationally. That worked until they were sobered up. If worse came to worse we would have rung the cops, which would be a difficult decision to make since there will be consequences for them both, but it would be a necessary one to stop them from endangering themselves and others. </p>
                
                
            <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
            <p>Although my identity is constantly changing, there are many different values important to me and parts of my personality that came about through my surroundings and common practises of the people around me.  A Lot of these values are ones I have kept because they are important to me and help to create better interactions and experiences for me and others while other negative values I choose to disregard since they don't do much service to me or others. My family environment stresses the importance of open-mindedness (improvement), honesty, generosity, hard work, gratitude, and going after your passions, to name a few. While my outer environment (the common values in my society) is big on politeness, manners, respect for others property, acceptance of others (regardless of their race, gender, religion, etc) and equality. My school environment shaped me the most because it was difficult for me and showed me mostly what i did not want which led me on the path to figuring out what i did want. It was online where i adopted a lot of my values and beliefs (watching youtube videos and reading articles on learning, parenting, successful people, health, following your dreams, mental health, etc).  It was also my work environments that helped me to find that i value teamwork and courage. All of these ‘cultures’ helped to create the person i am today by helping to figure out some of my strengths, likes, dislikes, weaknesses, and beliefs and values. </p>
            
            
                
                
            <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development :</h3> 
            <p>Some of my strengths : Optimism, faith, visionary, integrity</p>
            <p>I think my strength of faith and optimism will work together to help motivate me and keep morale up for others as well by helping them to see the better side. I am able to trust in others and in my own abilities and believe in the potential we all possess ( that we can do more than we thought possible). I believe things work out for the better as long as we keep trying and do our best even through failure and adversity. </p> 
            <p>I think my visionary strength will help keep me moving and adapting and growing into a better person, not only in my own career and skill but also in my personal life because i am able to believe in a better future and see that vision clearly.</p>
            <p>I think integrity will help me to develop good relationships with co-workers, and help with my communication and connection with others. I think  it is also good because i will stay strong to my own values in a diverse environment where opinions will be vast.</p>
            
            
            <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
            <p>Me and my friend tried to organize events where we would fundraise as part of a project we had to work on in school, and the others would only do the bare minimum and didn't really care much for the project. We wanted to do more but with the team we had we had to choose the easiest most local option so we decided to do a bake sale, it was good because everyone participated and did their part in the sale. We made a compromise so we could all be satisfied.</p>
